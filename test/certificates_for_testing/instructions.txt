Action to do for creating test certificates.

- Copy scripts in a Linux folder.
- Make them executable (ex.  chmod u+x authority-certificate.sh)
- run the authority script ./authority-certificate.sh mongo-test
  * Answer No (1) for crypt
  * Answer IT for country
  * Enter (".") for state.
  * Enter (".") for locality
  * Answer mongo-dart for Organization
  * Answer dev for unit name
  * Enter (blank) for common name
The data is asked two times.
at the end we should see:
***
   - Create the intermediate certificate .crt.
Certificate request self-signature ok
subject=C = IT, O = mongo-dart, OU = dev
***
The system creates the cert folder, and inside the following files:
\cert\mongo-test-ia.key
\cert\mongo-test-ca.crt
\cert\mongo-test-ca.key
\cert\mongo-test-ca-full-chain.crt
\cert\mongo-test-ia.crt

move to the cert folder (cd cert)
- run the server script for  5 servers (server1 server2, etc.)
  ../server-certificate.sh mongo-test 127.0.0.1 server1
  * Answer No (1) for crypt
  * Answer IT for country
  * Enter (".") for state.
  * Enter (".") for locality
  * Answer mongo-dart for Organization
  * Answer dev for unit name
  * Enter (blank) for common name

 now we create the client certificate.
 from inside the cert folder run the following command:
 ../client-certificate.sh mongo-test mongo 
  * Answer No (1) for crypt
  * Answer IT for country
  * Enter (".") for state.
  * Enter (".") for locality
  * Answer mongo-dart for Organization
  * Answer client for unit name
  * Answer test for unit name

As a result we will see:
Certificate request self-signature ok
subject=C = IT, O = mongo-dart, OU = client, CN = test
